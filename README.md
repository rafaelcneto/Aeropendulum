**Abstract:** Due to the complexity of the subjects covered in control engineering courses, many students have difficulty in resolving practical control problems. In order to solve this problem, didactic plants can be used as teaching tools to allow students to practice the design of controllers through the investigation of real physical systems. In this sense, this paper proposes an aeropendulum-based didactic platform to be used in control engineering courses. This paper cover all fundamental concepts about aeropendulums, a 3D-model built in Matlab/Simulink and some suggested practices that can be done using the proposed platform. The experimental results show that the proposed didactic platform is fully functional.

**Keywords:** Control Engineering, Didactic Platform, Aeropendulum, Non-Linear Plant.
